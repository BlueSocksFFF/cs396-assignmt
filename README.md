## Goal of the Design
Use parallel running to simulate the adaption in genetics and morphologies of randomized creatures. The goal is to move positively to the x direction.

## What I did?

Updated 5 ways to randomly modify and mutate:
1. Change the weights
2. Add a Sensor
3. Remove a Sensor
4. Add a link
5. Remove a link
