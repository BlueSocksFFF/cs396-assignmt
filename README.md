# Evoluation Simulation using Robots

## To Run
```
python search.py
```

## Goal of the Project
The project aims to simulate the process of evolution. What is life and how does life forms evolve in a world? While people mainly believe in the idea of "Survival of the fitness" from Darwinism, it is hard to evolve robots in this way. With the use of computation, we can simulate how robots would evolve in a world dedicated to one single goal: To walk/crawl/swim to the furthest in limited time.

## Methods
### Population and random seed



Updated 5 ways to randomly modify and mutate:
1. Change the weights
2. Add a Sensor
3. Remove a Sensor
4. Add a link
5. Remove a link
